Data files are provided in tab-delimited text format (data.txt) and comma-delimited 
text format (data.csv) under the \Data directory. Complete Scholars Resource catalog 
information is provided, keyed by filename to the vendor catalog number in each record.

Textbook correlation information is provided in the textbook.txt file in the \Data 
directory. This file lists filename, Scholars Resource catalog number, and correlation 
information for all images in this order to all textbooks currently offered by Scholars 
Resource. The file also specifies the set type, which indicates whether the image is 
the same as--or very similar to--the image in the textbook (Basic set), or whether it 
is an alternate view or similar work (Expanded set).

It is highly recommended that these images and their associated data be integrated into  
a third-party image database system. Contact Scholars Resource if you need assistance.
